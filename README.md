Welcome to Psychological Research with R!

The online book/ course for absolute beginners a.k.a. students whose dogs regularly ate their statistics homework.

This book is based on an introductory R course in psychology from the University of Konstanz.
It is very much a work in progress so please keep that in mind when giving feedback.
But do definitely check it out and let me know if anything is unclear! 

With this book I want to provide anyone with the tools to get started in R and learn the skills that you will actually need and use.
All the things you will learn are skills I use in my day-to-day, so maybe you will, too!

Cheers

Tave
