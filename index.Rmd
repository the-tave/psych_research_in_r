# About... {-}

**This book is still a work in progress! Most chapters are currently placeholders and will be filled over the next couple of weeks!**


<!-- This is a _sample_ book written in **Markdown**. You can use anything that Pandoc's Markdown supports; for example, a math equation $a^2 + b^2 = c^2$. -->

> It's actually more of a course but book sounds really fancy.

Welcome! 
Chances are, you are a psychology student and either starting to learn R or looking to refresh your memory.
Or perhaps you need to look up a specific step that you _can never quite remember_ (or is that just me?).
Maybe you also came across this resource by pure chance - lucky you! 

In any case I am glad you are here and hope you find both what you were and weren't looking for.
This book is based on an in-person introductory R course from the [University of Konstanz](https://www.uni-konstanz.de/).
I tried my very best to cover all the basics on working with R from the ground up. 
Following the whole course should enable you to write your very own R Markdown report, taking full advantage of some of the most important and common features of R.

That being said, this book is quite _opinionated_, meaning I included all the lovely things that _I_ like to work with.
You might prefer other packages and that is completely okay - I still appreciate you reading my suggestions.
As with anything in life, a lot can be learned from other peoples approaches to things. 


<!-- Each **bookdown** chapter is an .Rmd file, and each .Rmd file can contain one (and only one) chapter. A chapter *must* start with a first-level heading: `# A good chapter`, and can contain one (and only one) first-level heading. -->

<!-- Use second-level and higher headings within chapters like: `## A short section` or `### An even shorter section`. -->

<!-- The `index.Rmd` file is required, and is also your first book chapter. It will be the homepage when you render the book. -->

## ...the author {-}

I am Tave and I am currently working on my Ph.D. in Psychological Methods.
This online book is a little side project that is quite near and dear to my heart.

In my experience, statistics and - goddess forbid - statistics programs can easily induce panic-like states in psychology students.
And also in my experience, that can change over the course of one semester tops.
Programming in R is a lot less scary than many may think and most of all, it can and _should be fun_! 
<!-- LINK TO HILARY PARKERS TALK WHEN IT IS AVAILABLE! OR FONTI KAR -->
It is a weird, powerful language and can assist you with many everyday tasks.


I hope to alleviate some of the aveRsion over the course of this course and help you see R's advantages.
