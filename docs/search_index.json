Anni Tave Overlander Last update: 2024-09-16 About... ...this book This book is still a work in progress! Most chapters are currently placeholders and will be filled over the next couple of weeks! It's completely based on a course, so you can either look up specific facts or go through each chapter as you would a lesson. Welcome! Chances are, you are a psychology student and either starting to learn R or looking to refresh your memory. Or perhaps you need to look up a specific step that you can never quite remember (or is that just me?). Maybe you also came across this resource by pure chance - lucky you! In any case I am glad you are here and hope you find both what you were and weren't looking for. This book is based on an in-person introductory R course from the University of Konstanz. I tried my very best to cover all the basics on working with R from the ground up. Following the whole course should enable you to write your very own R Markdown report, taking full advantage of some of the most important and common features of R. That being said, this book is quite opinionated, meaning I included all the lovely things that I like to work with. You might prefer other packages and that is completely okay - I still appreciate you reading my suggestions. As with anything in life, a lot can be learned from other peoples approaches to things. Each chapter will end with a \"Wrap-up and Further Resources \"-section, i.e. a little collection of facts you should now know and some links for further reading. Also, in most chapters you will find some exercises or hidden code snippets, so you can test your skills as you go along. Important: I will present you with a lot of different packages that I believe will make your life easier in this book. Please make sure that you have them installed if you want to try out the code. You can typically install any package by typing install.packages(\"packagename\") - substituting packagename for the name of the package, e.g. dplyr - into your R console and hitting Enter. Some packages may not be installable this way, in which case I will explicitly mention how to install them where they are first used! ...the author I am Tave and I am currently working on my Ph.D. in Research Methods, Assessment and iscience. This online book is a little side project that is quite near and dear to my heart. In my experience, statistics and more so statistics programs can easily induce panic-like states in psychology students. And also in my experience, that can change over the course of one semester tops. Programming in R is a lot less scary than many may think and most of all, it can and should be fun! It is a weird, powerful language and can assist you with many everyday tasks. I hope to alleviate some of the aveRsion over the course of this course and help you see R's advantages. Please feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments!

What is R Studio? 1.2 Installing R and R Studio 1.3 Installing Packages Wrap-Up &amp; Further Resources", " Chapter 1 Intro and Installation If you have no prior experience with R, the different names can get a little bit confusing. There is R, but there is also R Studio and the two serve different purposes in your workflow. So in the following I will try to make a clear distinction and guide you through the installation of both R and R Studio. 1.1 What is R? What is R Studio? First of all, R is a programming language for statistical and data analysis. It is open source, which means anyone can contribute - an many many many people do. Like a lot of other programming languages, R can be used with the functions that it understands without any further instructions - we call this base R - or you can use packages - think of them as new tricks that you can teach your R. That might all sound intimidating at first but more than anything else it means that means that R follows instructions. The slightly tricky part is learning how to give those instructions. R Studio - typical layout 1.2 Installing R and R Studio Download &amp; Install the newest R version 4.3.3 (2024-02-29 ucrt) at https://cloud.r-project.org/ Download and install R Studio at https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/ R as a language can be used on its own. However, it is not very modern, quite hard to use and frankly just no fun. That's why we use R Studio as a user interface to run R. Think of it as dipping your fingers in a pot of ink to write versus using a pen and paper - you will still write with the same ink, but the whole process is just nicer. 1.2.1 Workflow You can give instructions or commands as they're rather called through the Console (bottom left tile) or in a Script in the Editor (top left tile). The way to choose which one you want is fairly simple: Console: If you quickly want to try a command, you need to install a package or you want to gather information about things like your working directory (we'll get to that later), then you want to use the Console. These are things that we do maybe once per session but usually don't need to reproduce. Editor: For pretty much everything else, we want to use the Editor. Here, we can create Scripts where we can save all the code that we write to use and find again any time. For most things - especially during the learning phase - it makes sense to write a Script in the Editor in order to be able to save and access the work. To do so, simply click the button and choose 'R Script'. Once we have a new script created, we can learn some basic things that R is capable of and save it to check out later. Math # Basic Math 1+2 [1] 3 2-3 [1] -1 3*4 [1] 12 4/3 [1] 1.333333 5^2 [1] 25 # Assigning Variables a &lt;- 3 b &lt;- 4 a-b [1] -1 a*b+5 [1] 17 In this code chunk, R is essentially being used as a calculator to perform basic math. While we want to make use of all the more powerful functions of R, it is important to grasp the basics and be able to use arithmetic for our purposes. Next to the basic mathematical operators, there are many nifty mathematical functions, such as sqrt() - square root, sum() or pi. We also added variables containing values (here a and b hold values 3 and 4 respectively) that can be used in the calculations just like the values they contain. As they only contain numbers, the variables a and b are called numeric. We can check this property of a variable, e.g. a using the function class(a), which gives us \"numeric\" as output. Usually when we fire up R, we don't just want to work with single values numeric but with data frames or vectors that can contain different classes of variables and several values respectively. # Vectors v &lt;- c(6, 7, 8) class(v) # [1] &quot;numeric&quot; d &lt;- c(&quot;sunny&quot;, &quot;rainy&quot;, &quot;foggy&quot;) class(d) # [1] &quot;character&quot; # Data Frame e &lt;- data.frame(v, d) class(e) # [1] &quot;data.frame&quot; Notice that we did not just add all values one after the other, but followed a certain notation that begins with the function c(). The c stands for \"combine\" or \"concatenate\" and tells R that all following values belong to the same variable. There are several ways of adding variables to a data frame, but the data.frame() command is the simplest. All values in a variable should have the same class. Go ahead and try out hm &lt;- c(3, \"sunny\", 5.2) and check the class. What happened - did you expect that? When we have our data in a neat data frame, what we usually want to do is access either certain rows or columns. To do so, base R uses square brackets [] behind the name of a data frame to indicate \"take this data, but only certain rows/columns/cells\". Remember: The brackets understand the first input as rows and the second as columns - rows right away. e # v d # 1 6 sunny # 2 7 rainy # 3 8 foggy e[1, ] # v d # 1 6 sunny e[ , 1] # [1] 6 7 8 weather &lt;- e[ , 2] weather # [1] &quot;sunny&quot; &quot;rainy&quot; &quot;foggy&quot; e[1, 1]*e[2, 1] # [1] 42 Our data set e contains three numbers in column c and different strings in column d. We can select just the first row, or just the first column or either of the other rows and columns that we have in the data. We can also re-assign the values, e.g. to a new variable named \"weather\" or perform calculations on single cells in the data frame - only if they contain numerics, of course. With square brackets we can only index rows and columns that are present in the data. That maybe sounds obvious, but can easily lead to confusion because of error messages! What happens when you try to index e[,3]? While it is common practice to work with data frames and edit them according to our tasks and needs, using square brackets and base R can get a bit humdrum. Luckily, many many people have developed many many packages that contain different functions, helping us in most tasks that we will need to tackle! 1.3 Installing Packages Hexagon Package logos Most packages are available on CRAN - the Comprehensive R Archive Network. That being the case you can easily install the package you want to have with the command install.packages(\"packagename\"). It is important to note that the package name must be in quotes for the installation, while loading it into a script works without quotes using library(packagename). Packages usually serve quite specific purposes, e.g. ones we will later get to know are dplyr, with which data handling is made a lot easier and more intuitive and ggplot2, which allows us to create beautiful, publication-ready plots and visualizations. What is special about these two, among some others, is that they were developed by the same person (Hadley Wickham), and are made available in a sort of \"meta package\" - the tidyverse. Installing and loading the tidyverse makes the functions from many different packages available at once. This is quite convenient when we want to use a lot of those packages in the same session or script, but does also take a longer time to load and is sometimes not actually necessary. To use this package of packages, please install the tidyverse, using install.packages(\"tidyverse\") in the console and then load it into your script (or, again, directly in the console, bottom-left) with library(tidyverse). You can test whether it works by running iris %&gt;% pull(Sepal.Length) %&gt;% mean() in your console. We will get to know the syntax in depth another time, but just so you know what's going on: This line of code takes the data set iris, which is included in R by default, \"pulls\" the variable Sepal.Length out of the data and runs the mean() function on it, to calculate the average sepal length, which should be 5.8433333. Wrap-Up &amp; Further Resources R is a powerful language, R Studio is the user interface we use with it R can be a calculator and perform basic and advanced math We mostly work with variables and data frames Packages make working with R easier and more fun!

The great advantage of that is we can assign values, vectors, text, matrices or almost anything else to variables and access them more easily later. To do that, we use the \\(\\leftarrow\\) like so: x &lt;- c(1, 2, 3) Go ahead and try it out! If you had too much fun assigning variables, you can remove them again from your work environment using the rm() command in the Console. So, if you assign the values 1, 2 and 3 to x, you can type rm(x) into the console, hit enter and x has disappeared from your environment! Execute a line of code with ctrl + enter in the editor In console you just need to press enter Text aka strings need to be put in quotes so it can be recognized as such some_text &lt;- c(\"amazing\", \"wow\") Comments can and should be added to your code using the # 2.1.1 Basic Functions a &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4) b &lt;- c(5, 7, 9, 11) mean(a) # [1] 2.5 sd(b) # [1] 2.581989 min(b) # [1] 5 max(b) # [1] 11 a+b # [1] 6 9 12 15 sum(b) # [1] 32 length(a) # [1] 4 v &lt;- 3:9 v # look at the variable # [1] 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 range(v) # [1] 3 9 d &lt;- c(10:15, 20:25) d # look at the variable # [1] 10 11 12 13 14 15 20 21 22 23 24 25 d[1] # index # [1] 10 d[d==10] # [1] 10 which(d==12) # [1] 3 You can practice these functions on your own and definitely check out the Exercises section! Brainteaser We define two variables in the following way: e &lt;- 1:5 f &lt;- 2:5 Let's say we want to access the number 5 in both variables. How come e[5] works but f[5] does not? Now, you may be wondering why I skipped the letter c and whether you should be taking the word of someone who clearly does not know their ABCs. The reason is quite simple: You already saw the function c() in the last chapter, which is used to create variables that are larger than one entry1. It stands for combine and it was used in the code above to create the variable d, containing two sequences. So, while you can use single letters as variable names for placeholders, it is generally not a great idea to use c - if we can avoid confusing for ourselves, we want to do it. There is a whole section on how to name your variables in Section 3.1 so that future-you won't be mad. 2.2 Logic Next to numeric variables like a and b that hold numbers, and string variables that hold \"text\", there are also so-called boolean variables. They can only hold the values TRUE or FALSE and are either assigned specifically by you, the user, or result from basically asking R a yes-or-no question. For example: # Is 3 smaller than 7? 3 &lt; 7 # [1] TRUE # Is 3 smaller than 2? 3 &lt; 2 # [1] FALSE Now, these examples are fairly trivial but boolean variables using logic can be really helpful, e.g. for filtering data. You can find the mean of some variable for a specific group by telling R your criteria and the operation you want to conduct on the filtered data. Let's say we asked some students about their gender and their skills with R. If we want to know the average R skills of male students we would tell R: \"If the gender of a participant is male, include them in the mean value for R skill\". So our code would look something like this: mean_r_skill_m &lt;- mean(data$r_skill[data$gender == &quot;male&quot;]) Of course, if you try to run this code you will probably encounter one of the errors described in the next section, because we do not currently have a dataset called data. But you can try out the principle with one of the Exercises! Depending on the analysis you need, you can use any of these so-called \"logic operators\": x &lt;- 4; y &lt;- 5 x &lt; y # smaller than # [1] TRUE x &lt;= 4 # smaller/ equal # [1] TRUE x &gt; y # greater than # [1] FALSE x &gt;= 3 # greater/ equal # [1] TRUE x == y # equal to # [1] FALSE x != y # not equal to # [1] TRUE z &lt;- TRUE z # [1] TRUE !z # [1] FALSE 2.3 Reading Error Messages Even the most advanced R coder will encounter the occasional error message. While they are quite helpful and usually lead to being able to solve problems, it can be challenging to learn how to properly read the message in order to actually understand what the problem is. Therefore, we will look at some of the most common wordings to decipher what R needs so it can understand what we want to do. Think of error messages not as discouraging faults of your program but rather as invites to help you help R understand what you are trying to achieve. Error: unexpected 'X' in \"Y\" This message is fairly straightforward: R expected a certain kind of symbol at the place where we put 'X' and is now confused because our input did not match the expectation. For most Europeans, for example, the most commonly used decimal separator will be a comma. Since R is an american-built language, however, it expects decimals to be separated with a decimal point while commas indicate separate inputs to a function. Therefore, when we accidentally input a decimal as '3,141', we will receive the error message Error: unexpected ',' in \"3,\" because R expected the input to be something like '3.141'. Fix: Replace the 'x' in \"Y\" with something that R can understand. Or alternatively: Make sure that we meant the input like that. Error: object 'A' not found This, too, is pretty understandable message: The object that you are trying to access and use cannot be found by R. The most common cause for this error message is probably simply that you misspelled the object name somewhere. R is case-sensitive, so maybe object A was defined as object a? Maybe the object vector is spelled vcteor in your function? Moreover, sometimes our thoughts are two steps ahead of our code. When figuring out how to get a program to work, sometimes we presume that a variable exists just because we need it and forget to define the variable up front. The same goes if we try to access a variable in a data frame that was maybe defined in a different data frame or as its own vector - it simply cannot be found because we are having R look in the wrong place. Fix: Make sure the object name is spelled correctly and was defined prior to using it in a function, calculation or elsewhere. This error message also often appears with \"function xyz not found\". In this case, we probably forgot to load the package first, which contains that function. Thus, the fix will likely be to figure out which package contains the function we are trying to use and load it with the library() command. Error: R does nothing after running a command This is not an error message but it is still very common, especially at the beginning of your learning journey. Usually, there is a &gt; symbol at the beginning of your console input line, which indicates that R is ready to run some code. However, if R is \"unfinished\" with a command, you see a + instead. This happens when R can`t work with the command because there is something missing, which in most cases, will be a closing parenthesis. Fix: Click in your console and use the Esc button to cancel the command. Then, look at the code you were trying to run and see if there is some closing statement such as ) missing and try again. The pipe operator |&gt; or %&gt;% Next to missing closing parentheses, a classic source for this behavior is the so-called pipe operator, created with either |&gt; (native R pipe, available since R version 4.1.0) or %&gt;% (tidyverse pipe from the magrittr package). It will be used a lot starting in Chapter 4 and it is probably one of my personal favorite R features. The pipe allows you to use previous operations in the next one easily and clearly. In reality this relates to not drowning in parenthesis and everything in the tidyverse is designed to be used with a pipe. Let me show you what I mean: We will create a variable that contains some numbers and we want to find the average value rounded to two decimal spaces. We already know the mean() function; to round a number we use the round() function and define how many decimal places to round to after we input the value we want to round. # Code without pipe round(mean(c(5, 9, 2)), 2) # [1] 5.33 # Code with pipe c(5, 9, 2) |&gt; mean() |&gt; round(2) # [1] 5.33 As you can see, both lines of code will give the same result but the pipeline follows a much more intuitive way of coding and allows you to write your code as you would think of the analysis. As opposed to that, in the first line you need to first think of rounding, then of the mean and then last input your actual values, which seems very backwards. Also, as I mentioned, you can see that there are already some parentheses next to each other, which would be really easy to forget and not receive any output. Generally, I wholeheartedly recommend getting familiar with piping very early on when learning R. However, don't forget that R expects input after each pipe. If you accidentally end a line of code with a pipe, you will encounter the behavior where R just does nothing and you basically have a staring battle of who will give in first. The same fix will work here: Hit the Esc button, look at the code you were trying to run and figure out if there might have been a pipe that just went nowhere. When you need help figuring out how a function works, there are several ways to get it. Try typing ? \"|&gt;\" into your console and hit enter! Pobody's Nerfect (source) So, always keep in mind: Mistakes happen to everyone. Error messages can be really frustrating but they really are meant to be helpful. Sometimes R has a hard time understanding what's wrong, so if an error message seems vague, think of it as your chance to play detective and figure out what happened. Also, I promise you that mastering the art of reading error messages can be tedious, but it is very worth it. Once you get a feeling of how R tries to identify errors, it gets a lot less disheartening. It can actually be quite wholesome to see a big, intimidating error message that makes absolutely no sense at all, just to find a teeny, tiny typo in your code which works once you fix it. Exercises Logic We want to find out whether the average Petal Length and Sepal Length of iris flowers are different from each other. Use what you know to \"ask R\" if those values are unequal! Hint: You will need logic, the mean()-function and square brackets. Use names(iris) to find all variable names in that data set. Solution Square bracket indexing with the variable name in quotes iris[ , \"Sepal.Length\"] iris[ , \"Petal.Length\"] now we add the mean function around both like this: mean(iris[ , \"Sepal.Length\"]) mean(iris[ , \"Sepal.Length\"]) Finally we compare the two with the != operator: mean(iris[ , \"Sepal.Length\"]) != mean(iris[ , \"Petal.Length\"]) TRUE Create a vector Create a vector x with the numbers from 50 to 100 and 150 to 200.

What that means for us is mostly that all our data exist as \"objects\" as far is R is concerned. Just like in real life, we can do stuff with those objects now, which is called using a function or command. Which brings me to the importance of proper names for all your variables, data sets, functions... Everything. If we go to the market and I tell you to get me an apple, you will probably be confused if there are many types of apples, maybe different colors, maybe different breeds. Basically, if I don't specify which apple I want, you are not able to pick out the right one. The same is true for R: If you try to call a function but fail to specify what object to use the function on, R is confused and throws you an error. Now, this may seem pretty obvious but it is a pretty common source of errors, especially during the \"steep phase\" of the learning curve. In R, abc is a different object than ABC, which is different from a_b_c, which is different from A.B.C. All of these variants are possible ways of naming your objects in R. However, it makes everyone's life significantly easier to stick to some naming-guidelines. Preferably use lower-case variable names, e.g. gender instead of Gender or GENDER. Preferably use an underscore to differentiate between different words in your object names if necessary, e.g. music_preference. Avoid using numbers in your names because likely either you or R will get confused with this at some point, e.g. raw_data instead of data12. Use abbreviations where useful, e.g. rt instead of reaction_times. Use names that will still make sense to you in the future, i.e. avoid names like asdf_data or blibblobfundata. The best case scenario would be that your variable names also makes sense to other people if they try to understand your code! I will admit that some of these pieces of advice are more opinionated personal experience than objective facts. The more you work with variables and maybe also code from other people, you may form your own opinions on what the best naming conventions are for you. I strongly suggest finding a way that works for you and sticking with it. As I described above, I personally will try to stick to lower_snake_case to name my variables because it is usually very clear, easy to read by humans and computers and would also be usable in any other programming language. Another thing that can take some time to get used to is avoiding white spaces in file names and any other names, for that matter. R has problems finding files with names such as \"My file with a really specific name.bib\", which can easily be avoided by sticking to snake_case: \"My_file_with_a_really_specific_name.bib\". The same goes for variables: In my first class, we discovered that it is possible in R to set a variable name with a space. Just because it's possible does not mean anybody should do it. Ever. You can try it out: Enter \"hi there\" &lt;- 5 in your console to assign the value 5 to a variable named hi there. You will see it appear in your working environment, but accessing the variable is virtually impossible. If you just type hi there in the console and hit Enter, R will give you an error à la \"unexpected symbol\". But if you type \"hi there\", it will echo the text back to you. Here is a list of positive and negative naming examples: great variable Spaces can technically work but are a hassle to access Areallysuperinsanelyverylongvariablename Variables are supposed to reduce workload Howaboutthis$ Special characters should be avoided age_grouped GenderRecoded aMAZING¯vARIABLE¯nAME Please just no. 3.2 Exercise: Creating Data meaningfully Imagine we are going to measure some test scores at a school that are supposed to reflect the kids' IQ (mean 100, sd 15). In order to prepare for data analysis, we want to simulate what the data might look like beforehand. We are going to measure their age and IQ score and we will be assessing class 7a and 7b. Create two data frames - one for each class. They should each contain n = 20 entries (for 20 kids) and 2 variables i.e. age and iq score. We assume age is a random number from 12 to 15 and iq follows normal distribution with mean = 100, sd = 15. Afterwards, add a variable to code the class to each data frame and add them together underneath each other. Use the functions on the board and look in the R help if you need more input on how to use them. Hint The functions you will need are data.frame, sample, rnorm, $, rbind and str.

I will also introduce you to the tidyverse - a collection of packages and why I strongly suggest to familiarize oneself with a bunch of them. Spoiler: It will make your life a lot easier. 4.1 Working with packages First off, when you stick to the metaphor a package being a collection of tricks to teach your R, then you will teach the tricks once and remind R that it knows the tricks every time you want to use them. In more real life terms, you will install a package once and load it in each new session. This is important to remember because installing packages is one of the few things you will only want to do in your console - NOT in any of your scripts. Nothing bad will happen if you do, but it takes a very long time and it will test both your own patience and that of your computer. Generally, packages can be installed with the install.packages() function. It needs the package name in quotes as input in the parentheses, e.g. install.packages(\"dplyr\"). This means the package is now on your computer but you still need to make it available. The easiest way to achieve that is to load the whole package using the library() command. This will usually be done inside a script where you want to use functions from that package. Later in this chapter, when we look at dplyr functions on the iris data in Section 4.3, you will see a code chunk as a prototype of a typical beginning of an R script. While library() makes all functions from a package available, you can also only load specific functions right when you want to use them. This works with the notation package::function() and is particularly useful if (1) the package is extremely large, takes a long time to load and/or you really only need the one function or (b) the function name you want to use is not unique, i.e. there are several packages that contain a function of that name. For example, the function filter exists in more than one package, so you might use dplyr::filter() in your code to make explicit that you want to use the filter() function from the dplyr package. When this is the case, you will get the message \"The following objects are masked from...\" in the console when you load the package. This is also good to keep in mind if you run into unexpected errors - maybe you meant to use the function from another package but R is using the one you loaded last? In the interest of creating reproducible code, it can also make sense to use the package::function() notation, so you can explicitly show others which function you used. At a glance: Install packages with install.packages() only once in the console! Load packages with library() every time you load a script or start a new session Usually in the script, but also in the console Specific function from a package: package::function() Use if you just need that one function once and don't want load the entire package Or to explicitly show the according package Or the function name is also in other packages (e.g. \"filter\" is usually dplyr::filter, but sometimes stats::filter) 4.2 The tidyverse The tidyverse is an opinionated collection of R packages designed for data science. All packages share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structures. (tidyverse.org) So packages are pretty cool: They usually come from people who had a specific problem, found a solution and decided to share it with others so they can more easily fix new problems. Of course everyone has a different preference on how to work, which is why not every package and function will be intuitive to everyone. That is also why the definition of an \"opinionated collection of R packages\" is so fitting because the tidyverse is a framework consisting of many different packages that the authors find intuitive and useful. Incidentally, I agree and I will show you why. If you figure out at some point that your prefer another way - that's great, but the tidyverse is a solid starting point for most data science needs in psychology. The structure of the tidyverse packages is very clear and they each serve a distinct purpose. Taking a real-life workflow as inspiration, we will first get to know dplyr, a package for cleaning up data and editing everything to your needs in this chapter and later get to know ggplot2 as a package for data visualization in Chapter 7. One of the big advantages of the tidyverse packages is that the can be combined very easily, creating easy-to-read and -write workflows that you will probably still be able to understand one year after you wrote it3 4.2.1 What is dplyr? The dplyr package is probably the best and most important package in R imho. It is a powerful tool for editing data in data frames and a great way to keep your workflow clear and reproducible. It has very intuitively named functions that on their own already serve most purposes that you will commonly need to properly work with your data. If you haven't already, now would be a good time to install dplyr and load it into a practice script: install.packages(\"dplyr\") \\(\\rightarrow\\) library(dplyr) In the following, we will use a data example to get to know some of the most important functions. Try to follow along and remember that you can always get more info on a function with a question mark in front of the function name in the console (here best to add the package name), e.g. ?dplyr::filter. If you want more general information on the whole package you can use the command browseVignettes(package = \"dplyr\") in the console. Also check the further resources and an overview of the most important dplyr functions. 4.3 Intro to dplyr Types of Iris Flowers We introduced the iris data set in Section 2 - a native R data set that you can just access without needing to load anything. It contains information on iris flowers of different species and we will use the glimpse() function from dplyr to get a first overview of the data we have at hand: dplyr::glimpse(iris) # Rows: 150 # Columns: 5 # $ Sepal.Length &lt;dbl&gt; 5.1, 4.9, 4.7, 4.6, 5.0, 5.4, 4.6, 5.0, 4.4, 4.9, 5.4, 4.… # $ Sepal.Width &lt;dbl&gt; 3.5, 3.0, 3.2, 3.1, 3.6, 3.9, 3.4, 3.4, 2.9, 3.1, 3.7, 3.… # $ Petal.Length &lt;dbl&gt; 1.4, 1.4, 1.3, 1.5, 1.4, 1.7, 1.4, 1.5, 1.4, 1.5, 1.5, 1.… # $ Petal.Width &lt;dbl&gt; 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.2, 0.4, 0.3, 0.2, 0.2, 0.1, 0.2, 0.… # $ Species &lt;fct&gt; setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, setosa, s… Imagine... When working with \"real\" data, aka survey or experimental data, we will usually need to reshape, filter and generally edit the data a bit. This may sound a bit sketchy at first, but we do not want to fake or change any data, we just want to ensure that we have the highest-quality data set to work with that we can. In the example we will be working with, we have the following three goals for the data: We only want data from species \"virginica\". We are interested in sepal length. We want to adjust variable names. We later also want the species to be capitalized in our data &amp; to add a new binary variable for whether a flower's petals are longer than 5.5 cm (1) or not (0). Using dplyr functions, we can easily achieve all these goals in a few lines of code. We will go more into depth library(dplyr) iris_virginica &lt;- iris %&gt;% # create new data set as copy filter(Species == &quot;virginica&quot;) %&gt;% # 1. only virginica select(Petal.Length, Species) %&gt;% # 2. select columns rename(plength = Petal.Length) # 3. rename variable/column str(iris_virginica) # &#39;data.frame&#39;: 50 obs. of 2 variables: # $ plength: num 6 5.1 5.9 5.6 5.8 6.6 4.5 6.3 5.8 6.1 ... # $ Species: Factor w/ 3 levels &quot;setosa&quot;,&quot;versicolor&quot;,..: 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 ... 4.3.1 Filter filter scheme Filters data by a value in a variable With filter we keep only certain rows in our data Needs logical operators as input \"keep only cases where variable x has value abc\" Can also be used with the ! to drop certain cases Drop NAs: data %&gt;% filter(!is.na(variable)) 4.3.2 Select select scheme Selects variables based on their names With select we keep only certain columns in our data Needs variable names as input \"keep only variables with this name\" Can also be used with the ! to drop certain variables Cave: if we want to extract one variable to calculate something, you will want to use pull() instead Check iris %&gt;% select(Species) %&gt;% class() and iris %&gt;% pull(Species) %&gt;% class() 4.3.3 Rename This is probably the most intuitively named function: It renames a variable in a data frame. As input the function takes your new variable name, an equal sign and the old variable name. This order is important, so if you run into an error, make sure that you are using new_variable = old_variable. Also, you do not need quotes around your variable names. 4.3.4 Mutate We also want the species to be capitalized in our data We also want to add a new binary variable for whether a flower's petals are longer than 5.5 cm (1) or not (0) for this, we use the ifelse() function: Needs a logical as first input, then what to do if it's true, last what to do if it's false Mutate takes a variable name as input (existing or new) and some function or calculation to be done on that variable iris_virginica &lt;- iris_virginica %&gt;% mutate(Species = toupper(Species), # 4. change content of Species and add new binary variable bigboi bigboi = ifelse(plength &gt; 5.5, 1, 0)) table(iris_virginica$Species) # # VIRGINICA # 50 4.3.5 group_by &amp; summarize With the dplyr-workflow, we can easily output group statistics Keywords: group_by() &amp; summarize() The code is built like any other dplyr workflow with pipes ( %&gt;% ) in between each: Define/ name the data frame group_by(variable_name) in summarize, define a name for the statistic, use a =, use a function like mean() for the measure str(Orange) # use different default data set # Classes &#39;nfnGroupedData&#39;, &#39;nfGroupedData&#39;, &#39;groupedData&#39; and &#39;data.frame&#39;: 35 obs. of 3 variables: # $ Tree : Ord.factor w/ 5 levels &quot;3&quot;&lt;&quot;1&quot;&lt;&quot;5&quot;&lt;&quot;2&quot;&lt;..: 2 2 2 2 2 2 2 4 4 4 ... # $ age : num 118 484 664 1004 1231 ... # $ circumference: num 30 58 87 115 120 142 145 33 69 111 ... # - attr(*, &quot;formula&quot;)=Class &#39;formula&#39; language circumference ~ age | Tree # .. ..- attr(*, &quot;.Environment&quot;)=&lt;environment: R_EmptyEnv&gt; # - attr(*, &quot;labels&quot;)=List of 2 # ..$ x: chr &quot;Time since December 31, 1968&quot; # ..$ y: chr &quot;Trunk circumference&quot; # - attr(*, &quot;units&quot;)=List of 2 # ..$ x: chr &quot;(days)&quot; # ..$ y: chr &quot;(mm)&quot; Orange %&gt;% group_by(Tree) %&gt;% summarize(m_age = mean(age), m_circumference = mean(circumference), n = n()) # # A tibble: 5 × 4 # Tree m_age m_circumference n # &lt;ord&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;int&gt; # 1 3 922. 94 7 # 2 1 922. 99.6 7 # 3 5 922. 111. 7 # 4 2 922. 135. 7 # 5 4 922. 139. 7 Exercises Data Munging Imagine we want to edit the iris data set for our colleagues from the US, who are interested in the petal width of the setosa and versicolor species.

The pipe - available as a native R pipe |&gt; or a tidyverse pipe from the magrittr package %&gt;%4 - takes the input from the left-hand to the right-hand. In simpler terms, it takes the operation you did before the pipe and uses is as input for the function after the pipe. This keeps our code readable and tidy and allows us to keep edits in separate lines, but we still only have to run one command for every task we need It's easy to add new commands by using another pipe operator, or to leave edits out but commenting out the respective line of code. It is important to say that most things can be achieved with or without pipe and you may prefer different versions for different tasks. You have seen a basic example of the use of the pipe operator in Section @ref(#pipe1), so now we will look at a more sophisticated example: We will perform similar operations as we did above and code them first with pipe and then without. # With pipe iris_edit &lt;- iris %&gt;% filter(Petal.Length &gt; 3) %&gt;% # only big petals select(Species, Petal.Length, Sepal.Length) %&gt;% # only those columns mutate(random_calculation = Petal.Length * Sepal.Length) # calculate random new variable # Without pipe - two versions iris_edit2 &lt;- filter(iris, Petal.Length &gt; 3) iris_edit2 &lt;- select(iris_edit2, Species, Petal.Length, Sepal.Length) iris_edit2 &lt;- mutate(iris_edit2, random_calculation = Petal.Length * Sepal.Length) iris_edit3 &lt;- mutate( select( filter( iris, Petal.Length &gt; 3 ), Species, Petal.Length, Sepal.Length ), random_calculation = Petal.Length * Sepal.Length ) # Are the three versions equal? all.equal(iris_edit, iris_edit2) &amp; all.equal(iris_edit, iris_edit3) # [1] TRUE As you can see, all three version produce the same output and all are technically correct. However, in the second example we keep re-assigning new edits to the same data frame (would be even more annoying but possible to assign each edit to a new data frame) and the third version is just quite the nightmare to read if you ask me. Also think about this: In the part with pipe we used the iris data to edit and assigned it to iris_edit. In version two without pipe we used iris in the first line, but afterwards we used iris_edit2 for assignments and edits. Why is that? If we were to use iris in each line, it would overwrite the last edit every time. We can also profit from the pipe in base-R or with a larger combination of different functions. Usually, the pipe helps us not to drown in parentheses when conducting analyses. Let's e.g. calculate a mean value after filtering by Species setosa. So without a pipe, it might look like this: round(mean(iris$Petal.Length[iris$Species == &quot;setosa&quot;]), digits = 2) # [1] 1.46 Using all pipes, the code would look a lot longer but still easier to read. iris %&gt;% filter(Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) %&gt;% pull(Petal.Length) %&gt;% mean() %&gt;% round(digits = 2) # [1] 1.46 As a third alternative, we might also use a combination of the approaches, such as: round(mean(filter(iris, Species == &quot;setosa&quot;) %&gt;% pull(Petal.Length)), digits = 2) # [1] 1.46 As with most things in R and programming, different approaches may be easier in different situations, so it has merit to think outside the box at times! Brainteaser : We want to edit the iris data to rename a Petal.Length to pl and mutate it to be multiplied by ten. Why does the first version work, but not the second one? # Version 1 iris %&gt;% mutate(Petal.Length = Petal.Length * 10) %&gt;% rename(pl = Petal.Length) %&gt;% glimpse() # Version 2 iris %&gt;% rename(pl = Petal.Length) %&gt;% mutate(Petal.Length = Petal.Length * 10) %&gt;% glimpse() In the second version, we rename the variable Petal.Length to pl and afterwards try to access it with its old name.

Here: Please install the readr package with install.packages(\"readr\") In my experience, it is easiest to work with data where you have an idea of what to expect. 5.2 Different types of data sources Data collected from WEXTOR - like from many other sources - will be exported in the CSV format, which stands for comma-separated values. That means that this type of data has one row per participant and the values for each column (variable) are separated by a delimiter 5. When our data comes from an Excel file, it will often be exported as CSV because this type of storing data is pretty efficient and uses up very little space on the disk. A more modern but also more space-consuming way of storing Excel table data is in the XLSX format (Not an acronym, just stands for \"Excel Spreadsheet\"). Many people use SPSS for statistical analysis and creating dataframes. These data will be stored in a file with the extension SAV. Generally speaking, SAV files are compatible with R. However, there are some specialties which can cause problems, such as SPSS labels. We won't go into depth on this, just know that R can sometimes recognize SPSS labelled variables as their own class, in which case the class of those variables should be corrected manually 6. Finally, of course we can also encounter datafiles that were created in R. In this case the will have .Rds as the file extension. A special case of this is when data frames are included in base-R or in a package. For example, the dataset called iris comes with R as an example dataset. Therefore, we can run a function on it without having to load it at all: head(iris) # Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species # 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa # 2 4.9 3.0 1.4 0.2 setosa # 3 4.7 3.2 1.3 0.2 setosa # 4 4.6 3.1 1.5 0.2 setosa # 5 5.0 3.6 1.4 0.2 setosa # 6 5.4 3.9 1.7 0.4 setosa Depending on which type of data we want to work with, there are different ways of loading the data into R. 5.3 Reading in the data There are two main ways to load data: via the \"Import Dataset\" menu under the Environment-tab or (only) using code and if necessary packages. In the menu, simply select the option \"Import Dataset\" menu under the top-right Environment-tab and use From text (readr) for csv or other text files (such as .txt). Note that this menu also offers the possibility to load data from Excel and SPSS. However, this is much easier done by just using simple commands directly in your script: Data Source R command WEXTOR (CSV) readr::read_delim(\"data.csv\", delim = \";\") Excel (XLSX) xlsx::read.xlsx(\"data.xlsx\", sheetIndex = 1) R Data Source (RDS) readRDS(\"data.Rds\") SPSS (SAV) foreign::read.spss(\"data.sav\") 5.3.1 Reading in the data 5.3.1.1 Generated Code library(readr) seminar_data_raw &lt;- read_delim(&quot;data/seminar_data_raw.csv&quot;, delim = &quot;;&quot;, escape_double = FALSE, trim_ws = TRUE) View(seminar_data_raw) 5.3.2 Basic Edits Choose an appropriate name, e.g. raw Put all library commands at the top of the script so you are ready to conduct all analyses You do not need the View() command in your script If you are not sure about the state of your data, look at it first!

However, in order to be able to work with the dataset in easily in the future, we should do some more advanced edits. Specifically, we will: Change the date format so we get a start and end variable including time and date instead of separate date and time variables Remove the unnecessary original date and time variables Change the one missing value in v12_soul_phil to \"dunno\" Rename the ID variable to ID &amp; session length variable to session_length Make our data type explicit using as.data.frame() Save our edited data in an R data set (Rds) format so we can use it more easily later! I suggest using some of the dplyr commands that were introduced in the last chapter for edits 1 through 4. You can try to figure them out on your own and later look at the solution below. I highly recommend you follow along with these steps, as we will use this dataset in later chapters7 Solution seminar &lt;- seminar |&gt; # 1. Change date format mutate(start = as.POSIXct(paste(v.wx.5.start_date, v.wx.4.start_time), format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;), end = as.POSIXct(paste(v.wx.7.end_date, v.wx.6.end_time), format = &quot;%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S&quot;), .before = v01_gender) %&gt;% # it is more efficient to have date and time together # 2. Remove (now) unnecessary original date vars select(-c(v.wx.4.start_time, v.wx.5.start_date, v.wx.6.end_time, v.wx.7.end_date)) %&gt;% # 3.

Loops are automations that take care of repetitive tasks Typically, we might go through data row by row and perform a task Loops can have different forms: for: loop over a pre-defined set of values, such as a number sequence while: define constraints and keep loop running as long as they are met repeat: loop repeats until broken (I do not recommend this ever!) For is most common, while is nice for more advanced simulations 6.1.1 What are conditionals? Conditionals define different actions for different conditions They follow intuitive language: if: define action to take when condition is met (logical) else if: defince action for another condition else: define action for everything else ifelse is the shortcut-function we already got to know for recoding with mutate() defines exactly 1 condition, 1 action, 1 alternative expandable version of ifelse is case_when 6.2 Exercise: What should I use? I want to print numbers from 1 to 7! for loop (but realistically 1:7 ;) ) I need to simulate more data as long as my sample size is smaller than 200! while loop I want to print the age of only the females in my sample! if/ else 6.3 for-loop In a for loop, we need to define the range for which the loop should run We define an iterating variable that will change each time the loop runs and take on all values of the defined range Typically, we call this variable \"i\" We define the range in round brackets and all actions the loop should take in curly brackets 6.3.1 Example for(i in 1:4){ print(paste(&quot;The iteration is&quot;, i)) } # [1] &quot;The iteration is 1&quot; # [1] &quot;The iteration is 2&quot; # [1] &quot;The iteration is 3&quot; # [1] &quot;The iteration is 4&quot; 6.3.2 Conditionals: If - else if(variable == &quot;value&quot;){ print(&quot;Do something&quot;) } else if(variable == &quot;other_value&quot;){ print(&quot;Do some other thing&quot;) } else { print(&quot;Do anything else&quot;) } 6.3.3 Conditionals: If - else 6.3.3.1 Checking numbers | We want to test whether numbers in a loop are divisible by 3. If they are, we will display \"Divisible by 3\", and if not, we will simply output the iteration number like before. For that we will use the modulo %% , which gives us the rest of a division. Let's try it out! for(i in 1:4){ if(i %% 3 == 0){ print(&quot;Divisible by 3!&quot;) } else { print(i) } } # [1] 1 # [1] 2 # [1] &quot;Divisible by 3!&quot; # [1] 4 6.3.4 Exercise Use a for-loop to display your favorite numbers. The numbers should be between 10 and 25. If the number is divisible completely by 5, you should output \"Divisible by 5!\", if not please output the iteration number only.

We want to create a loop that goes through all rows (all seminar students) and outputs their height and whether it is above or below average. What do we need for that? 6.5.1 Elements For each person: Check if their body height is above average If yes: Output \"This person is taller than average with ...\" Else: Output \"This person is less tall than average with...\" Then paste the person's body height Loop that over each person!

When and why do we need it? What do we want to accomplish? 7.1.1 Data Viz has many many applications Our readers/ listeners can follow us better with data viz Statistics are much easier to understand with a visual representation Mostly, we want to be able to see our data ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Having a visual representation can be helpful in understanding relationships between variables Many common statistics make assumptions about the distribution of our data, so we need to check/test that! 7.1.2 Example: Sine &amp; Cosine ...are trigonometric angle functions with a special relationship This relationship cannot be found with common statistics - the correlation Data Viz helps us not to make wrong assumptions about our data! 7.2 What is ggplot2? Probably the best data visualization package in R Powerful tool for visualizing data Part of the tidyverse ♥ library(ggplot2) 7.2.1 Most important ggplot2 functions 7.2.1.1 ggplot() The main function for \"opening the canvas\" This function prepares R for the plot definition Commonly, we define the data set and which variables to plot in this function Needs the aesthetics function aes() as input It's important to remember that the package is called ggplot2 while the function call is ggplot! 7.2.2 geom_XYZ() Defines the actual type of plot = geometric objects When data is pre-defined, this function does not need additional input Can handle some \"pretty makers\", such as alpha, which defines color opacity geom_bar, geom_boxplot, geom_density, geom_jitter, geom_histogram 7.3 Example: Basic Bar Plot ggplot(iris) + geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width)) 7.3.1 Making Plots Prettier color visual property of the geometric object which color for the outlines colors() fill visual property of the geometric object which color to fill labs theme install.packages(\"papaja\") \\(\\rightarrow\\) library(papaja) 7.3.2 Example: Bar Plot with color and fill ggplot(iris) + geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width), color = &quot;deepskyblue3&quot;, fill = &quot;deepskyblue&quot;) What could cause this distribution? 7.3.3 Example: Bar Plot with color and fill ggplot(iris) + geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width, color = Species, fill = Species)) What do you notice about the code compared to before? 7.3.4 Static vs. Dynamic Aesthetics Static Aesthetics: Fixed values applied to all elements of the plot Example: color = \"deepskyblue3\" Means every element will have the same color. Dynamic Aesthetics: These map a variable in your data to an aesthetic, which allows different elements to have different colors based on the data Example: aes(color = Species) Means the color will vary according to the Species variable in the data set. 7.3.5 Exercise Create a density plot that shows Sepal.Length from the iris data set. Fill in the color depending on the Species and color the outlines with \"white\". Make sure everything is visible and legible, so try to use an alpha of around 0.6. ggplot(data) + geom_XYZ(aes(), alpha = ?) 7.3.6 Solution ggplot(iris) + geom_density(aes(x = Sepal.Length, fill = Species), color = &quot;white&quot;, alpha = .6) 7.4 Adding labels and themes A good plot should be self explanatory and clear We need labels to tell others what our plot shows Especially when using color for another variable, it needs to be clear what each color means Also the gray-ish default background is ok, but neither very pretty nor very clear It is sometimes advisable to keep grid lines visible, but sometimes they can be distracting and unnecessary ggplot2 has a lot of built-in theme options, but there are many packages that provide their own themes Usually my preference is papaja::theme_apa(), which adheres to APA guidelines 7.4.1 Same example with added theme ggplot(iris) + geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width, color = Species, fill = Species)) + theme_apa() What labels should we use in this plot? 7.4.2 Same example with added theme and labels ggplot(iris) + geom_bar(aes(x = Petal.Width, color = Species, fill = Species)) + theme_apa() + labs(x = &quot;Petal Width&quot;, y = &quot;Flower Count&quot;, title = &quot;Size of Iris Flowers&quot;) 7.5 Bivariate Visualizations The bar plot shows the distribution of a single variable We can add color to show groups Showing the relationship of two variables to each other is crucial for understanding our data We can still add color to make existing groups clearer or add a third variable For a broad overview of which visualization (and statistic) to use for which type of data, visit the Statistics Picker (currently only available in German) Most common are boxplots, scatterplots &amp; line graphs 7.5.1 Boxplot Example As suggested by one of you, we will look at the relationship of preferred music genre and music volume in our course: # seminar &lt;- readRDS(&quot;./data/seminar_data.Rds&quot;) ggplot(seminar, aes(x=v07_genre, y=v08_loudness, colour=v07_genre, fill=v07_genre)) + geom_boxplot(alpha = 0.7) + theme_apa() + labs(x = &quot;Preferred Music Genre&quot;, y = &quot;Loudness (arbitrary units)&quot;, color = &quot;Genre&quot;, fill = &quot;Genre&quot;) 7.5.2 Exercise: Boxplot Create a box plot that shows Sepal.Length from the iris data set grouped by the Species. Fill and color depending on the Species. Make sure everything is visible and legible, so try to use an alpha of around 0.7. Try to add labels and a theme. 7.5.3 Solution: Boxplot ggplot(iris) + geom_boxplot(aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length, color = Species, fill = Species), alpha = .6) + theme_minimal() + labs(x = &quot;Species&quot;, y = &quot;Sepal Length&quot;) 7.5.4 Inspiration: colors and palettes These plots have all used the default colors from ggplot2 There are many options for customization, either: Use the \"brewer\" palettes from ggplot2 with scale_color_brewer() or scale_fill_brewer() Choose single colors (static aesthetics), check colors() for R color names Create a color palette with all colors that you need and use it with scale_color_manual() or scale_fill_manual() Use a predefined color palette from packages like viridis or unikn or RColorBrewer... Have fun with it! 7.5.5 Use: colors and palettes Showing plots together like this is easy with cowplot::plot_grid()! Wrap-Up &amp; Further Resources ggplot2 is a powerful tool for visualizing data Plot commands are added together with + and executed as one A basic plot is created with ggplot() + geom_XYZ(), e.g. geom_bar color &amp; fill give you nice color options (static &amp; dynamic) labs() adds labels to the plot (i.e. x, y, title, ...)

I will assume that you have a basic understanding of what all statistics mentioned in this book are, as they are commonly used among psychologists. However, let's start with a brief statistics re-cap to be on the same page. Both the correlation - usually reported with Pearson's r coefficient - and the regression - also known as (general) linear model - give us measures of association. The association can be positive (the larger x, the larger y) or negative (the larger x, the smaller y), which is reflected by the sign of the coefficient: r = 1 would be a perfect positive correlation and r = -1 would be a perfect negative correlation. Hopefully, you have heard this one thousand times already, so let me tell you for the thousand and first time: Correlation does not imply causation. The correlation coefficient r only tells us about the direction and strength of the association and nothing about the causal relation. However, in the regression model we can check whether Y changes on the basis of X, so we can include assumptions of cause and effect in our model8 Figure 9.1: Age and circumference of orange trees shown in a scatterplot. We can see that there seems to be a positive relationship between the two measures: The older the tree, the larger the circumference. 9.0.1 Pre-Requisites Load the seminar data using Please make sure you are using the R dataset from the zip folder in ILIAS, not the original csv file we first used! seminar &lt;- readRDS(&quot;./data/seminar_data.Rds&quot;) # the filepath might need adjustment for you Some of you were having trouble loading the data - please repeat the different types of data in R and the different commands used to load them!

Soultion r1 = 0.3, r2 = -0.2, r3 = 0.8, r4 = -0.75 9.2 Correlation in R Two main functions: cor() calculates the correlation cor.test() calculates correlation and significance As input they both need only an x and a y variable You can specify some other aspects of the calculation, such as statistical method (e.g. \"spearman\") or how to deal with missing data x &lt;- 1:10 y &lt;- sample(x, 10) cor(x, y) # [1] -0.3333333 cor.test(x, y) # # Pearson&#39;s product-moment correlation # # data: x and y # t = -1, df = 8, p-value = 0.3466 # alternative hypothesis: true correlation is not equal to 0 # 95 percent confidence interval: # -0.7959163 0.3749953 # sample estimates: # cor # -0.3333333 9.2.1 Handling missing data Many functions have an option for missing data or NAs You can often add the argument na.rm = TRUE to a function for \"NA remove\" In the cor() function, we define to only use complete observations k &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) m &lt;- c(1, 3, 2, 5, NA) # same length but 1 data point is missing cor(k, m) # [1] NA With use = \"complete.obs\" we define to only use pairs of observations that are not missing cor(k, m, use = &quot;complete.obs&quot;) # [1] 0.8315218 cor(k[1:4], m[1:4]) # [1] 0.8315218 9.2.2 Exercise Is technology skill associated with seminar motivation?

In the YAML header, true and false are not capitalized, unlike in the rest of R! 10.2.2 Markdown Basics Text formatting generally works with characters in the text: italics with _italics_ bold with **bold** bold and cursive with **_bold and cursive_** Unordered lists are created with - Ordered lists with 1., 2. ... 10.3 ## Heading Basics 10.3.1 ### Sub Header 3. level 10.3.1.1 #### 4th level 10.3.1.1.1 ##### 5th level 10.3.1.1.1.1 ###### 6th level Thats's it. Realistically, we may want to go down to the 4th level heading, but usually no further. 10.4 Special Features Print mathematical equations Show code and its output Easily use automatic formatting Profit from existing templates General rule of thumb: Rmd documents are rendered depending on their output format If you plan on creating an html, you can use plain html to make adjustments and use special features. If you create a pdf, they will most likely not work and you should use \\(\\LaTeX\\) notation. 10.4.1 \\(\\LaTeX\\) Especially useful for writing equations: $ \\ alpha $ \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(\\alpha\\) $ \\ beta $ \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(\\beta\\) $ R^2 $ \\(\\rightarrow\\) \\(R^2\\) and, by the way, $ \\ rightarrow $ becomes \\(\\rightarrow\\) and $ \\ LaTeX $ becomes \\(\\LaTeX\\) \\ newline creates a new line and \\ newpage creates a new page 10.4.2 HTML Remember these tags should only be used when creating a html document! &lt; br &gt; creates a new line (stands for \"line break\") &lt;span style=\"color: purple;\"&gt; This text will appear purple. &lt;/span&gt; This text will appear purple. Simple tables can be created with html notation in most documents Header 1 | Header 2 then a row of - - - | - - - to represent the lines And the content separated | into as many columns as defined 10.4.3 Table Example Header 1 | Header 2 -----|----- Great content | Fantastic content Becomes: Header 1 Header 2 Great content Fantastic content 10.5 Including R Including R code can be achieved by either inserting so-called code chunks or using inline code Code chunks are useful if several lines of code need to be evaluated and/ or shown There are many options for code chunks Inline code is useful if single outputs are to be shown E.g. with functions you already know such as apa_print() 10.5.1 Code Chunks Code chunks are inserted via the menu Code &gt; Insert Chunk and should look like this: ```{r} # code goes here ``` # code goes here Or you can use the keyboard shortcut ctrl + alt + i / command + option + i Chunk Options Inside the curly brackets, you can specify many different options, for example: fig.height = 3 will output a plot to a certain height (3 inches) echo = F will show code output, but not the code eval = F will show the code, but not its' output... eval = F: head(iris, 1) echo = F: # Sepal.Length Sepal.Width Petal.Length Petal.Width Species # 1 5.1 3.5 1.4 0.2 setosa error = TRUE This option allows us to include erroneous code in our script It will output the error message just like you would see in your R Studio console By default, error = FALSE which means that your script cannot be rendered with errors in code chunks mean(y) # [1] 5.5 Wrap-Up &amp; Further Resources RMarkdown allows you to create professional documents You can use it like other text-generating programs (e.g. MS Word) Embed plots, code and statistical results directly in your document Show equations and use other special features YouTube: What is R Markdown?

Add 'subtitle: \"A great subtitle\" ' to the YAML header How do I generate a section header in my document? With the pound sign # Header Oh no, my header isn't showing up right! What could have happened? There needs to be a space between the # and the header 11.1.1 Quiz - general R What package contains the functions select, filter &amp; mutate? dplyr (or tidyverse) Assume I have created some R project and I read a file with the following command - what does this tell you about the folder on my computer? greatdata &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = &quot;./data/somefile.CSV&quot;) The folder containing the R project contains a subfolder called \"data\" and in there is a CSV file called \"somefile.csv\". 11.1.2 Quiz - general R I want to load a csv file into R with readRDS(). Why isn't it working? The read commands are specific to the file format. readRDS() is for R files, read.csv() or readr::read_csv() are needed for csv files What do you know when you look at the command bigfive$extraversion? There is a data set called bigfive and we're accessing a variable called extraversion 11.1.3 Quiz - general R What keywords for loops and conditionals do you remember? for, while, if, else, ifelse... I want to calculate a t-test on soul-belief (yes or no) and age in our seminar data. Why won't this command work? t.test(v02_age, soul_dummy, data = seminar) When we have a grouping variable like soul_dummy, we need to use formula notation: v02_age ~ soul_dummy 11.2 Back to Rmd: Last session First off: the option of formatting the table of contents to float in html is toc_float: true Create Rmd: or File &gt; New File &gt; R Markdown YAML header defines format of the document as well as key info such as title, date, etc. Text formatting: italics with _italics_ bold with **bold** Unordered lists are created with - Ordered lists with 1., 2. ... 11.2.1 Last session Code chunks are inserted via the menu Code &gt; Insert Chunk and should look like this: ```{r} # code goes here ``` keyboard shortcut ctrl + alt + i / command + option + i Chunk options can specify how to treat code, e.g. echo = FALSE only shows output but does not \"echo\" the actual code Indentation and spacing is very important! In the text, it is better to add more. In the YAML header, it may not be recognized properly with improper spacing 11.2.2 Including Links &amp; Images An image to R Markdown is essentially a link to an image file on your computer That's why they share similar notation Web Link:** \"Google Link\" Becomes: Google Link (clickable Link) Image: \"\" Different file formats, such as JPG, PNG, SVG or GIF When including an image, make sure you are using the right file path, image name &amp; file extension!
