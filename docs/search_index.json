Anni Tave Overlander 2024-07-23 About… This book is still a work in progress! Most chapters are currently placeholders and will be filled over the next couple of weeks! …this book It’s actually more of a course but book sounds really fancy. Welcome! Chances are, you are a psychology student and either starting to learn R or looking to refresh your memory. Or perhaps you need to look up a specific step that you can never quite remember (or is that just me?). Maybe you also came across this resource by pure chance - lucky you! In any case I am glad you are here and hope you find both what you were and weren’t looking for. This book is based on an in-person introductory R course from the University of Konstanz. I tried my very best to cover all the basics on working with R from the ground up. Following the whole course should enable you to write your very own R Markdown report, taking full advantage of some of the most important and common features of R. That being said, this book is quite opinionated, meaning I included all the lovely things that I like to work with. You might prefer other packages and that is completely okay - I still appreciate you reading my suggestions. As with anything in life, a lot can be learned from other peoples approaches to things. …the author I am Tave and I am currently working on my Ph.D. in Psychological Methods. This online book is a little side project that is quite near and dear to my heart. In my experience, statistics and - goddess forbid - statistics programs can easily induce panic-like states in psychology students. And also in my experience, that can change over the course of one semester tops. Programming in R is a lot less scary than many may think and most of all, it can and should be fun! It is a weird, powerful language and can assist you with many everyday tasks. I hope to alleviate some of the aveRsion over the course of this course and help you see R’s advantages.

"],["hello-bookdown.html", "Chapter 1 Hello bookdown 1.1 A section", " Chapter 1 Hello bookdown All chapters start with a first-level heading followed by your chapter title, like the line above. There should be only one first-level heading (#) per .Rmd file. 1.1 A section All chapter sections start with a second-level (##) or higher heading followed by your section title, like the sections above and below here. You can have as many as you want within a chapter. An unnumbered section Chapters and sections are numbered by default. To un-number a heading, add a {.unnumbered} or the shorter {-} at the end of the heading, like in this section. "],["cross.html", "Chapter 2 Cross-references 2.1 Chapters and sub-chapters 2.2 Captioned figures and tables", " Chapter 2 Cross-references Cross-references make it easier for your readers to find and link to elements in your book. 2.1 Chapters and sub-chapters There are two steps to cross-reference any heading: Label the heading: # Hello world {#nice-label}. Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 2. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 2.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 2.1. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 2.1: Here is a nice figure!

Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter).

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2024) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References Xie, Yihui. 2015.

If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
