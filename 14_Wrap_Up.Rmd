## Discussion of Self-Study Materials

- Solutions to the quiz will be uploaded on ILIAS
- Specific questions, Fibonacci task, the template HTML and any additional questions

### Fibonacci Task

- Thanks to whoever the rest of you copied! ;)
- Most of you used `numeric(15)` to create a variable with 15 zeros
    - This is fair enough, but can lead to errors: If it contains numbers already, it is harder to detect calculation mistakes (0 is often a valid possibility)
    - Better to use NAs to create a placeholder variable: `rep(NA, X)` 
    - 
    ```{r}
    rep(NA, 15)
    ```
    
### Fibonacci Task

```{r}
n <- 15

fibonacci <- c(1, 1, rep(NA, n-2))

for(i in 3:n){
  fibonacci[i] <- fibonacci[i-1] + fibonacci[i-2]
}

fibonacci
```

### Alternative with `while`

```{r}
fibonacci = c(1, 1)


while(length(fibonacci) < 15){
  new_num <- fibonacci[length(fibonacci)] + fibonacci[length(fibonacci) - 1]
  fibonacci <- c(fibonacci, new_num)
}

print(fibonacci)
```

## Template HTML

![Rmd Example Template](./img/Rmd-exc1.png){height=600px}


```{r echo = F}
cowsay::say("What the duck is this?", by = "duck")
```


## Lessons from the useR!

Many people are working on many great projects.

```{r}
ohwhaley::say()
```

 R can be hard.

... but it's worth it.

 Data Analysis is important in so many fields.


 R is really fun!


### Work with a scientifically sound AI

## "Pub" Quiz - Which function is missing? & Logos

Work in groups of 2-3 and submit your answers via kahoot. 

You will see some code snippets where the function name is missing - which is it? 

Afterwards you need to judge which package logo is the right way round!



<small> Big Thanks to Deepansh Khurana for providing materials and inspiration! </small>

## Outlook

Keep teaching yourself R - you have a lot of great resources!

```{r}
# Keep finding cool features (like the emphatic package)
iris |> 
  group_by(Species) |> 
  summarize(Mean_Sepal_Length = mean(Sepal.Length)) |> 
  emphatic::hl(c("purple", "violet", "hotpink"))
```

### Anything left unclear?
